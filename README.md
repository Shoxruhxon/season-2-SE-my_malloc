# Task
The task was that, we had to create a family of dynamic memory allocation functions, namely malloc, realloc, calloc, and free.

# Description
The malloc() function maintains a number of buffers in fast bins. These are a small number of fixed buffer pools from which memory can be allocated when an application requires memory without having to make a system call.

# Installation
To use or install this program, you must have and use the GNU compilator or Makefile.

# Usage
Compile the code first, then it will give you the output file. When you call that output file it will show you that all functions belonging to the memory allocation family are working.
